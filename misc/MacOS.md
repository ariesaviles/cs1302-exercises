# Setup on MacOS

The following instructions are designed to help get you up and running with macOS for development
in CSCI 1302. The majority of the time, you will not be developing directly on your Mac. Instead,
you will use your Mac to connect to a remote server via a terminal emulator. Once connected, the
commands that you type and the programs that you run will be executed on the remote server instead
of on your local machine.

## Open Terminal

MacOS comes with a [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator)
called [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac).

1. **Open Terminal.** On your Mac, do one of the following:
   * Click the Launchpad icon

     in the Dock, type `Terminal` in the search field, then click **Terminal**.
   * Click the Spotlight icon

     in the upper-right corner of the menu bar (or press Command-Space), type `Terminal` in the search field, 
     then click **Terminal**.
   * In the Finder 
     <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/5B9190B30946221279C5A608/5B9190B30946221279C5A60F/en_US/937fa92677a2c49a18fa81070e5d8419.png" width="15" height="15">, 
     open the `/Applications/Utilities` folder, then double-click **Terminal**.
     
2. **Explore.** At its core, macOS is powered by a powerful Unix-like kernel called 
   [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)). 
   Via Terminal, you can interact with your system using most Unix commands.

## Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for MacOS. It makes it really easy to install programs
on your Max via [Terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac). 

1. **Open Terminal.**

2. **Install Homebrew.** Type the following command:
   ```
   $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   ```
   The `$` denotes the shell prompt. In exampes like this, the `$` lets you know that the line
   that follows is to be typed in your terminal emulator at the shell prompt, which usually ends
   with `$` followed by a white-space. 

3. **Install Utilities.** Type the following command:
   ```
   $ brew install git wget
   ```
   
## Install XQuartz

[XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) is an open-source version of the 
[X.Org X Window System](http://www.x.org/) that runs on MacOS.
Installing XQuartz will enable you to forward the graphical user interface
for remote programs that you write later in the semester to your local machine.

1. **Open Terminal.**

2. **Install XQuartz.** Type the following command:
   ```
   $ brew cask install xquartz
   ```
   
3. **Restart your Mac.** The best way to restart your Mac is to choose Restart from the Apple (ï£¿) menu.

## Setup Your Nike Account

Once you have your Nike login information, follow the steps in
["How to Connect to Nike & First Steps"](NikeSetup.md) to ensure
that your account is setup properly for this course. 
**Failure to do this will cause problems with your course work.**
